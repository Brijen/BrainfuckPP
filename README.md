# Brainfuck++ #

## What is it? ##

Brainfuck++ (or BrainfuckPP) is a new specification of Brainfuck, and a Brainfuck++-to-C++ parser and compiler.
It is currently in alpha, so it doesn't have all the nice features that will come soon.

## How do I use it? ##

Like this:

	make					# Will build Brainfuck++
	./bf++ <input file>		# Converts brainfuck to C++
	make output				# Builds the resulting C++ file
	./bf_out				# Runs the executable

****

That's all for now, documentation will be added soon!
